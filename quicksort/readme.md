# Quicksort
- Divide and Conquer principle
- Implemented by many programming languages
- Partition technique
    - Pivot
    - Smaller than pivot -> left
    - Greater than pivot -> right
- Elements to the left and right will be sorted recursively

## Complexity
- Worst Case: O(n^2)
- Very efficient!
    - Average case: theta(n log n)
    - Best case: ohm (n log n)
- Space complexity: O(n log n)
