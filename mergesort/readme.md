# Merge Sort
- Divide and conquer
    - Divide
        - divides problem to smaller sub-problems
    - Conquer
        - sub problems solved recursively
    - Combine
        - solutions of sub problems are combined to achieve final solution

## Complexity
- Worst Case: O(n log n)
    - improvement over bubble, selectuion and insetion
    - suitable for sorting large lists
- Average Case: theta(n log n)
- Best Case: Ohm(n log n)
    - other algo have better best case complexity
- Space Complexity: O(n)
